    <h1>The background Property</h1>

    <p>The background property is a shorthand property for specifying all the background properties in one declaration.
    </p>

    <p>Here, the background image is only shown once, and it is also positioned in the top-right corner.</p>

    <p>We have also added a right margin, so that the text will not write over the background image.</p>


    <pre>
    When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

    background-color
    background-image
    background-repeat
    background-attachment
    background-position

    It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order. 
    </pre>
